Inter-application Audio Driver


Soundflower is a virtual audio device that provides an
easy and simple way for Max/MSP and other applications
to send and receive audio to and from any other application.  
Running with very low latency and cpu usage, Soundflower
allows each client application to use its usual buffer size.


## Installing Soundflower
Run the Soundflower Installer.pkg.  You will be asked for
an administrator account password.  One file, Soundflower.kext,
will be installed in the Extensions Folder.  The remainder of the 
supporting files will be installed to /Applications/Soundflower.

If you experience difficulty installing Soundflower, it is
recommended that you run the Uninstall Soundflower applescript
that is provided on the disk image.


## Using Soundflower
Soundflower presents itself as one of two coreaudio devices. 
In most cases, you will want to use the 2-channel device.

To send the output of one application to another, simply select
Soundflower as the output device within the first application
and Soundflower as the input device within the second
application.

If an application does not allow you to specify audio devices,
you can make Soundflower the default input or output device
inside the Sound panel in the System Preferences, or with
the Audio MIDI Setup utility application.

The 16-channel device is provided for more complex routing
situations, and can be used with more than two applications
simultaneously if the applications support audio routing to any
channel, as Max/MSP does.

Note that Soundflower's audio channels represent a global audio
space.  If more than one application is sending its output to the
same channel, the audio will be mixed.  If you want an application
to send and receive audio through Soundflower, (for instance using
Max/MSP to manipulate and return another application's audio)
you must send and receive the audio on different audio channels
or a feedback loop will be created.


## Example
To send audio from iTunes to Max/MSP, open the System 
Preferences and select Soundflower (2ch) as the device for
sound output inside the Sound panel.  Then, inside Max/MSP's 
DSP Status Window, select Core Soundflower (2ch) as the input 
device.   All output of iTunes should now be sent to Max/MSP's 
adc~ object.


## Troubleshooting
If you are hearing clicks or breakups, try increasing the buffer size of
both applications (set within each application).


## Removing Soundflower
From an account with administrator privileges, double-click on
the Uninstall Soundflower.scpt file.  This will run an
AppleScript, in which you will be asked for your password.
